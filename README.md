__asg__ - association  chain graph package, first  implementation  of the SNHA
algorithm. This package mainly exists to build a GUI version of the algorithm.
If you like to use the algorithm for you analysis it is recommended to install
the SNHA package.

This github pages host the GUI application and the R-library for the St.
Nicolas House Algorithm which allows to create correlation networks based on
association chains. For more background on the theory of this algorithm have a look at the following publications:

* Groth, D., Scheffler, C., & Hermanussen, M. (2019). Body height in stunted Indonesian children depends directly on parental education and not via a nutrition mediated pathway-Evidence from tracing association chains by St. Nicolas House Analysis. Anthr Anz, 76(5), 445-451. [DOI: 10.1127/anthranz/2019/1027](https://doi.org/10.1127/anthranz/2019/1027)
* Hermanussen, M., Aßmann, C., & Groth, D. (2021). Chain Reversion for Detecting Associations in Interacting Variables - St. Nicolas House Analysis. Int J Env Res Pub Health, 18(4), 1741. [DOI: 10.3390/ijerph18041741](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18041741)

The graphical application and the library needs an installed version of [R](https://www.r-project.org) on
your computer. To use this software from this page please install R first
either using your package manager or usually for Windows and Mac-OSX using the download facilities of the R-project:
[https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html)
 
## St. Nicolas House Analysis - Graphical User Interface

### Windows

For users which are not experienced R users there exists a graphical user
interface which can be installed either using the standalone single R-script
file or, for Windows systems, using a Windows installer which can be downloaded from here:

[snha-install.exe](https://github.com/mittelmark/asg/releases/download/v0.10.1/snha-install.exe)

### Linux / MacOS / FreeBSD

For Unix  systems  like  Linux,  FreeBSD  or MacOS  there is as a single  file
application: 

- Linux/FreeBSD [snha-gui.Rz](https://github.com/mittelmark/asg/releases/download/v0.10.1/snha-gui.Rz)
- MacOS [snha-gui-macos.Rz](https://github.com/mittelmark/asg/releases/download/v0.10.1/snha-gui-osx.Rz)

Download this file and either run the file directly from a terminal with Rscript like this

```
Rscript /path/to/snha-gui.Rz
```

or make the file  executable  like this `chmod 755  snha-gui.Rz` or 
`chmod 755 snha-gui-macos.Rz`and move the
file thereafter to a folder belonging to your PATH variable and renaming it to
`snha-gui` or so , so that you can execute this
file from any folder by just typing  `snha-gui` in the terminal  regardless
of your current working directory.  


### MacOS

Please note, that on Mac-OS you need usually to have a X-Server installation
for instance of [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) and you have to start the application from a
X-terminal. In some cases you might as well change the first line of the file
`snha-gui.Rz` so that it points to the right Rscript interpreter on your hard disk.

## Library

For advanced users as well the R-library can be download and installed
separately. It offers more features to modify the analysis and the graphical
output then the GUI but needs the usual knowledge of the R statisical programming language.

You can install the package directly from Github using the following lines of code from within your R-console:

```
URL="https://github.com/mittelmark/asg/releases/download/v0.10.1/asg_0.10.1.tar.gz"
install.packages(URL,repos=NULL)
library(asg)
```

You should be then able to start to analyse your data like this:

```
data(swiss)
data=swiss # fill in your data
as=asg.new(data)
plot(as,layout="sam")
```

A good place to start is the help page of the *asg.new* function.
